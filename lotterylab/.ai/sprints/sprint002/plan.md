# 🧮 Sprint 002 — Core Analyses

- Dates: Next sprint → +14 days
- 🚀 Goal: Implement comprehensive randomness tests and statistical analysis to verify lottery randomness claims
- 🗺️ Scope: IN — Statistical tests, randomness validation, pattern analysis, enhanced visualizations. OUT — ML models, production deployment

## 📦 Deliverables
- Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, runs test, autocorrelation, entropy analysis
- Randomness test suite with statistical significance reporting
- Pattern detection (consecutive numbers, arithmetic sequences, digit analysis)
- Enhanced visualizations: correlation heatmaps, time series trends
- Statistical analysis API endpoints
- Comprehensive randomness validation reports

## 🔧 Stories & Tasks
- [x] Implement chi-square goodness-of-fit test for number distributions
- [x] Create randomness test API endpoints (`/api/v1/analysis/randomness`)
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for randomness functions (chi-square, entropy, coverage)
- [x] Add Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for distribution comparison
- [x] Implement runs test for sequence randomness
- [x] Add autocorrelation analysis for temporal dependencies
- [x] Calculate Shannon entropy for randomness quantification
- [x] Create pattern detection algorithms (consecutive numbers, sequences)
- [x] Add digit analysis (last digit distribution, sum patterns)
- [x] Implement correlation heatmap visualization
- [x] Add time series trend analysis
- [x] Add pattern analysis endpoints (`/api/v1/analysis/patterns`)
- [x] Enhance UI with statistical test results display
- [x] Add downloadable analysis reports (PDF/Excel)

## ✅ Acceptance criteria
- All statistical tests return p-values with proper interpretation
- Randomness tests can process 10k+ draws in <5 seconds
- Pattern detection identifies known lottery patterns accurately
- API endpoints return structured statistical results
- Visualizations clearly show statistical significance
- Reports export successfully in multiple formats

## 🧪 Validation & Demos
- Cross-validation of statistical test results against known distributions
- Performance benchmarking against large datasets
- UI integration testing with interactive statistical displays
- Report generation testing with sample data

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
- Statistical computation performance → Implement streaming algorithms, cache results
- Complex mathematical correctness → Peer review, reference implementations
- UI complexity for statistical concepts → Progressive disclosure, clear explanations

## 📊 Metrics / DoD
- 15+ statistical test functions with comprehensive tests
- API response time < 2s for standard analysis
- Test coverage > 85% for analysis modules
- Clear documentation of statistical methods and interpretations
